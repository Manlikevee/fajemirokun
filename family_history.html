            Fajemirokun was born as one of the three children (Osuntola, Fajemirokun and Fajemisonu) of his father Ola arerin. He grew up to be an active young man, full of strength and energy, burning with passion for adventure. He was a very successful man in all ramifications. As a warrior, he successfully fought many wars, in alliance with others including Ologbenla, a personal and close friend, who later reigned as the Ooni of Ife. One of his wives was a daughter of this Ooni.  
<br>
            This was the time of the Yoruba wars. With the war camps in Ibadan, Oke-igbo and the Ekiti Parapo wars in Ido-faboro Ekiti.

          Fajemirokun and Ologbenla decided to join the other warriors to defend the Oduduwa nation. They both joined the Oke-Igbo war camp. Fajemirokun left home at the prime of his youth to settle down in Okeigbo. He lived at the highest point in Okeigbo -Okejege where there was a watch tower to sight the enemies. He spent a greater part of his life in Okeigbo. 
<br>
Our father was an Okeigbo- Sanmi. He fought in the Yoruba wars as a great warrior as part of the spoils of war he acquired many slaves. He had a plantation where the slaves were his labour force. Hence this appellation ogbigbo ba lori igi eri pekun oko Balagbe.

        As a farmer, Fajemirokun’s farmland was so large as to be incorporated into the “Oriki” of the man. The saying goes thus: “Ogbigbo ba lori igi giga, sugbon ko ri ipekun oko Balagbe” Literal translation is that the bird Ogbigbo, perching high on a high tree is unable to see the boundary of Fajemirokun Balagbe’s farmland. 
 <br> <br>
        Perhaps because he needed a lot of manpower to work on such large expanses of farmlands, Fajemirokun had to have many children both male and female. In the end, he was reputed to have had 26 wives and 44 children that survived infancy. As of today
        He was wealthy. Apart from being a warrior, a farmer he was also a successful trader navigating the entire Osun province. 
        <br> <br> 
        Some of his children’s names reflected his connection with Oshun province – like Oshunkunle, Oshunnigbagbe and Oshungbohun. He believed in educating his children and registered an army of children from his household in school. That was the genesis of the family bearing different names as his children registered school in their first names like: AkinsanyaOshun- kunle, Akingbola, Famakinwa Akinlade, Odudeyi, Gbeyide etc.
        <br> <br>

        Some gradually changed their names later in life to reflect the name of their father -Fajemirokun.
        Balagbe Te ko ko ko was his alias (Inagije) because he was a socialite. He was a man of great reputation and fame. A great warrior, a great farmer and a merchant trader. Over and above all these he was a handsome man (Eni obirin ko loja ko ko ogbola) he was an Amulu dun at parties. 
        <br> <br>
        When Ologbenla   installed Bale in Okeigbo. Fajemirokun felt it was time to return home as he deserved a similar honour. He returned to Ifewara as an old man having been away for so many years. A lot of water had passed under the bridge. Ifewara already had a ruler, Fajemirokun had to accept the second in rank- the Orunto. 
        Fajemirokun – is said to have passed on in 1904 and was buried in Akodi Fajemirokun in Ifewara.
